            <b class="bold">BACKSTORY:</b>
            I have loved to draw since I was young, and though I do not draw as much as I used to, it is still a passion I hold close to my heart. Doing art comes with its challenges, but it very much comes with its rewards as well. I did not start practicing art seriously until high school and by some point I was drawing practically everyday. I don't think I'll ever enjoy any other activity as much as drawing, and that is part of the reason why I chose to study art in college. Although I am not sure if I will ever become a full-time artist, I am still latching onto this dream of mine, because it is the one thing I want. I want to master drawing. That is my life goal, whether that comes with a job or not is something I'll have to find out for the future.
