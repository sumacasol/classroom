           This website was created as a space to explore and exhibit some of the things I am most passionate about. Although these things are centered around my interests and preferences, someone else could easily find they have similar tastes or discover something that sparks their curiosity! Take your time to look through each page, hope you enjoy :)

            I feel my passions can be a blessing and a curse. By this I mean they are an abundance of explorations and endeavors as well as an overwhelming stream of choices that at many times require preserverance and dedication. Whatever way you choose to see it however, I cannot deny the pure pleasure and enjoyment my passions bring me.
